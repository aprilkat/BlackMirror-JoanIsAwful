            Societal biases sourced from the media significantly shape our view of others</p>
        <p>Use of Social media is growing and as it grows so does it's influence on our lives and views of the world.
            41% of Americans believe that use of
            social media is increasing [2]. From January of 2023 to January 2024, the number of social media accounts
            grew by 8% - from 4.72 billion to 5.04 billion accounts [2]. </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 5%; font-weight: lighter;">[2]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Wider use of social media is not the only thing growing. It's influence on our lives is also increasing. 70%
            of teenagers check social media accounts multiple time a day and 24% have reported that they have been
            negatively affected by it [15].</p>
        <p>Social media is experiencing significant growth and as it becomes more relevent in people's lives, it has the
            potential to impact us posititively and negatively. It shapes our views of others, perpetuates stereotypes,
            reinforces inequalities, and influences our views of important topics and the people around us.
        </p>
        <p>Social media can effect society negatively through perpertuating stereotypes. Anyone can say anything on the
            internet with little to no consequences. This leads to misleading, untruthful, and harmful content. In July
            2020, 58% of Americans stated that they belived that media reinforces harmful stereotypes [17]. 68% also
            stated
            that media is undermining stereotypes [17]</p>

        <p>An example of this is a current ongoing TikTok trend called #Girlmath. The trend targets woman and helps
            rationalize spending and making purchases with irresponsible logic.
            For example, the idea that if you pay in cash youâ€™re not spending real money or that if something cost less
            than five dollars it is free. This trend may have
            started out as a joke however it promotes bad behavior and perpetuates the stereotype that women are more
            immature and
            less competent with finances than men. A majority of the time the initial message of
            these trends may not be apparent, appearing as only a joke, however the underlying implication can undermine
            the groups that are targeted by these trends.
        </p>
        <p>Social media can also affect the way we make decisions. Recent studies have found that 40% of people look to
            social media for travel advice. People also seek advice regarding other sectors icluding 25% in financial,
            22% in retail, 20% in healthcare. Due to people's desire to seek out advice on social media, it is easier
            than ever to spread misinformation and manipulate people. A study found that 84% of people agree that media
            made it easier to manipulate [?]. As use of social media continues to grow it is important to evaluate it's
            impact on our decisions and the implications of misinformation regarding these decisions.</p>

            AI-generated content is changing the creative landscape in Hollywood</p>
        <p>AI has the potential to greatly inhance our creative capabilities. AI can automate tasks that a repetative or
            time consuming such as editing. This would remove the need for humans and allow creative professionals to
            focus on innovative aspects of filmaking. In 2023, about 20% of film is edited using AI [8]. AI also has
            potential as a screenwriting tool. AI is making video production as easy as typing or speaking, filmmakers
            are able to use AI programs like Storia to create detailed storyboards prior to production [6]. AI can be
            used to analyze viewer preferences and viewing habits to assist writers and producers in creating content
            that resonates with audiences.
            Nearly 77% of repondents used AI image generators to enable faster landscape photos to screens to post
            production [10]. Producers can now save money and improve effiecency by using generative AI to produce
            virtual characters and environments [11].</p>

        <p>There are ethical and economic implication with the use of AI that must be considered. AI could potentially
            people to lose their jobs in special effects, animation, and even acting. By 2026, it is estimated that 20%
            of all entertainment industry jobs - roughly 118,500 positions - will be lost to AI [10].
            We also must consider the loss of artistic control and creativity that AI may cause [7]. We are trading the
            authentic human touch in the creative process for the precision and efficiency of AI. Despite these
            potential drawbacks of utilizing AI, investors have spent $50 billion on generative AI, however 90% of
            startups only offer minor improvements [6].</p>
