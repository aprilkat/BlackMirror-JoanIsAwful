            style="font-size: 25px; margin: auto; width: 80%; text-align: center; padding-bottom: 2%; padding-top: 4%;">
            Formal education on information privacy needs to be implemented in all public schools.
        </p>
        <p>This change will
            support a culture of data privacy consciousness. If Joan grew up in a world where information privacy was a
            priority, she may have taken a second look at those terms and conditions. Streamberry Services might’ve
            thought twice about deceiving subscribers if they thought they couldn’t get away with it. Kids K-12 are
            vulnerable to data breaches. In a 2019 report published by the Code.org Advocacy Organization,
            the Computer Science Teacher Association, and the Expanding Computing Education Pathways Alliance reported
            that
            only 45% of high schools in the United States teach computer science [1]. This is an unacceptable statistic
            as it shows the increasing knowledge gap on a topic that will become increasingly important as time goes on.
            Furthermore, a 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 92% of American teens constantly post
            photos of themselves and 82% share their birthdate [2]. A similar majority also share their school name,
            hometown, and relationship status [2]. Pieces of personal information like the ones mentioned are common but
            unacceptable uses for passwords, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology [3]. For
            these reasons, school-aged kids are especially susceptible to data breaches and need to be taught more
            robust data
            security.</p>
        <figure style="width: 55%; margin: auto;">
            <img src="CCH-figure-1.png" alt="Internet Accessibility Growth" title="Internet Accessibility Growth"

            <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 5%; font-weight: lighter;">[4]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Another reason this education reform needs to take place is that it has the power to reap generational
            benefits. Access to the Internet is increasing every year. Of the
            demographic researched, 48% said that the reason they do not have Internet access at home was simply because
            they do not use it and were “not interested” [4]. We need to foster a culture of internet safety and culture
            that is on pace with how fast internet accessibility is expanding. </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 5%; font-weight: lighter;">[5]</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, the government needs to take a tougher stance on data privacy to protect its citizens. The United
            States promotes an “opt out” system when it comes to data collection. This puts too much responsibility on
            the individual user. This is a stance that prioritizes big tech over the well-being of its citizens. For
            reference, the European Union is almost strictly “opt in” [5]. If the US continues this path of
            prioritization, the least they could do is supplement with formal education beside basic math, science, and
            English.

        </figure>
        <p>AI has the potential to greatly inhance our creative capabilities. AI can automate tasks that a repetative or
            time consuming such as editing, this would remove the need for humans and allow creative professionals to
            focus on innovative aspects of filmaking [8]. In 2023, about 20% of film is edited using AI [8]. AI also has
            potential as a screenwriting tool. AI is making video production as easy as typing or speaking, filmmakers
            are able to use AI programs like Storia to create detailed storyboards prior to production [6]. AI can be
            used to analyze viewer preferences and viewing habits to assist writers and producers in creating content
            that resonates with audiences.
            Nearly 77% of repondents used AI image generators to enable faster landscape photos to screens to post
            production [10]. Producers can now save money and improve effiecency by using generative AI to produce
            virtual characters and environments [11].</p>

        </figure>
        <p>There are ethical and economic implication with the use of AI that must be considered. AI could potentially
            people to lose their jobs in special effects, animation, and even acting. By 2026, it is estimated that 20%
            of all entertainment industry jobs - roughly 118,500 positions - will be lost to AI [10].
            We also must consider the loss of artistic control and creativity that AI may cause [7]. We are trading the
            authentic human touch in the creative process for the precision and efficiency of AI. Despite these
            potential drawbacks of utilizing AI, investors have spent $50 billion on generative AI, however 90% of
            startups only offer minor improvements [6].</p>

        </figure>
        <p>AI can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used to create predictive success models, which can analyze
            vast amounts of data from past film performances to predict box office success with greater accuracy.
            Helping studios produce the best movies and films [8]. Warner Bros used AI predictions which had 70%
            accuracy rate of predicting film performance [8]. Predictive AI can also be used to gather information
            through social media and online reviews to gauge audience sentiments and preferences allowing producers to
            tailor their content to viewer preferences [8]. Generative AI is transforming how we experience films
            through Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). It enables the creation of adaptive and interactive
            media, where viewers can step into virtual worlds crafted by AI algorithms [11]. These environments are not
            only
            immersive but also allow real-time interaction with characters and settings, providing a personalized
            narrative experience that adjusts and evolves based on viewer responses [11]. AI tools are also
            revolutionizing
            the entertainment industry by enhancing the quality of visual effects. These advanced technologies enable
            filmmakers to create highly realistic CGI that integers seamlessly with live-action footage, expanding the
            boundaries of creativity [7]. This transformation allows for the depiction of intricate scenes–from
            futuristic
            cityscapes to epic space battles-making cinematic experience more immersive and visually striking for
            audiences [7].

        <p>Use of Social media is growing and as it grows so does it's influence on our lives and views of the world.
            41% of Americans believe that use of
            social media is increasing [13][14]. From January of 2023 to January 2024, the number of social media
            accounts
            grew by 8% - from 4.72 billion to 5.04 billion accounts [13][14]. Wider use of social media is not the only
            thing growing. It's influence on our lives is also increasing. 70%
            of teenagers check social media accounts multiple time a day and 24% have reported that they have been
            negatively affected by it [15].</p>
        <p>Social media is experiencing significant growth and as it becomes more relevent in people's lives, it has the
            potential to impact us posititively and negatively. It shapes our views of others, perpetuates stereotypes,
            reinforces inequalities, and influences our views of important topics and the people around us.
        </p>
        <p>Social media can effect society negatively through perpertuating stereotypes. Anyone can say anything on the
            internet with little to no consequences. This leads to misleading, untruthful, and harmful content. In July
            2020, 58% of Americans stated that they belived that media reinforces harmful stereotypes [17]. 68% also
            stated
            that media is undermining stereotypes [17].</p>

        </figure>
        <p>An example of this is a current ongoing TikTok trend called #Girlmath. The trend targets woman and helps
            rationalize spending and making purchases with irresponsible logic [16].
            For example, the idea that if you pay in cash you’re not spending real money or that if something cost less
            than five dollars it is free [16]. This trend may have
            started out as a joke however it promotes bad behavior and perpetuates the stereotype that women are more
            immature and
            less competent with finances than men [16]. A majority of the time the initial message of
            these trends may not be apparent, appearing as only a joke, however the underlying implication can undermine
            the groups that are targeted by these trends.

        <p>Social media can also affect the way we make decisions. Recent studies have found that 40% of people look to
            social media for travel advice [18]. People also seek advice regarding other sectors icluding 25% in
            financial,
            22% in retail, 20% in healthcare [18]. Due to people's desire to seek out advice on social media, it is
            easier
            than ever to spread misinformation and manipulate people. A study found that 84% of people agree that media
            made it easier to manipulate [19]. As use of social media continues to grow it is important to evaluate it's
            impact on our decisions and the implications of misinformation regarding these decisions.</p>
