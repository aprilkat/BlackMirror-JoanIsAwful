    <div class="page-content">
        <p>Joan Is Awful is a social commentary on the power of networked communications in a highly connected society.
            Streamberry, a simulated Netflix standin', is integrated into the entertainment features of many homes
            across the Joan is Awful universe. The widely accessible streaming platform rolls out a new concept, the
            source of contention: a series of episodes that captures and dramatizes the lives of random Streamberry
            subscribers [1].
        </p>
        <p>Immediately after the airing of the initial episode, word of the show spreads swiftly. Joan receives numerous
            texts from relatives and friends expressing their disappointment in her and how she is portrayed. Joan’s
            stress levels exponentially increase as she watches her life unfold on the television, and it falls to
            pieces right in front of her. Her social media is flooded with hate comments and narratives. The biggest
            driver of her unfortunate rise to fame is the sensationalized scenes generated by less-than-glamorous events
            in her life [2].</p>
        <p>The textbook discusses internet interactions at length. It lists fourteen ways the public uses the internet.
            The most relevant regarding the context of Joan is Awful is the methods in which we buy, sell, socialize,
            and distribute content. Streamberry sells entertainment to consumers. Then, they generate subscribers who
            buy the service in exchange for entertainment; they are the primary audience for the new show, Joan Is
            Awful, and contribute to its widespread popularity. Because of the big hit that was the show, it is brought
            up in conversation and spread across other platforms; it is used as a tool for socializing. Short clips,
            reactions, memes, and other internet content are distributed [3]. How the public utilizes the internet is
            diverse and often overlaps each other. In this instance, that works against Joan as she battles the
            monstrous tide of the fast and often unforgiving Internet.</p>
        <p>Another relevant section in the textbook discusses the breach of trust any Internet user may be subject to.
            Joan attempts to sue Streamberry for filming her life without her permission and broadcasting it to the
            platform. She thinks she has a case for identity theft and cyberbullying. Unfortunately for her, her lawyer
            explains the airtight terms of the agreement she signed precursing her subscription [4]. According to them,
            any subscriber is subject to having a show made about them; Joan was the first unlucky target. </p>
        <p>The show comes to an end when Joan breaks into Streamberry and smashes the quantum computer that makes the
            show possible [5]. In doing so, she erases her reality and only the original Jane is left. While this wraps
            up the ending nicely, the real world is not as merciful. Content on the Internet is hard to scrub off as a
            consequence of how interconnected these networks are.</p>
        <p>Communication networks are what made Joan Is Awful such a compelling and realistic portrayal of the power of
            the Internet. Every day, billions of new pieces of content are being uploaded and reshared. While Joan’s
            case may be limited to a fictional television show, this reality may not be far off in the future.
