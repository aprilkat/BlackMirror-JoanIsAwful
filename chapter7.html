        <h3>Chapter 7: Computer and Network Security</h3>
        <h6>Written by Ryan Nguyen</h6>
        <p>The show Black Mirror: Joan is Awful touches upon the theme of computer and network security. In the show,
            Joan learns when talking with her lawyer that an AI quantum computer is creating a CGI version of her and
            depicting her life in a show. Confused, she learns that her phone, computer and other devices are listening
            to her and that is how the computer gets information about her life to make the show [1]. If her devices
            were more secure and her information wasn’t leaked, then the generated show would not exist. Towards the end
            of the episode, Joan makes an effort to stop the show by destroying the quantum computer responsible for
            generating the content. Joan and Salma consider hacking into the computer however they aren’t able to as the
            system is too secure [3]. To instead solve their problem they visit the computer in person to physically
            destroy it [2]. If Joan or Salma had the ability to hack into the quantum computer they could have either
            changed the outcome of the generative AI or they could’ve utilized that technology instead of destroying it.
            However, upon reaching the computer Joan realizes she is in a simulation, and by destroying the quantum
            computer she is able to escape the simulation she is in.</p>
