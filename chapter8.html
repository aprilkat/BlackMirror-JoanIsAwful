        <h3 class="page-title">Chapter 8: Computer Reliability</h3>
        <h6 class="page-title">Written by April Bollinger</h6>
        <p>Reliability is an important topic to consider when producing software and/or hardware. A well-designed system
            can operate through the malfunction of any single component without causing harm [1]. In Black Mirror: Joan
            is Awful, Streamberryâ€™s lack of understanding of their quantum computer and the lack of physical security or
            backups employed to protect the computer resulted in a complete loss of one of their services. Failures of
            computer systems or computer-driven systems can result in lost money or time, and even injury or death [1].
        </p>
        <p>In this case, the quantum computer itself was the weak link [1]. The physical reliability of the quantum
            computer was severely lacking. Joan and Salma Hayek were able to access and destroy the quantum computer
            relatively easily [2]. Steamberry also only had one quantum computer, which made its destruction even more
            disastrous to the company. They failed to take appropriate steps to ensure that their assets were protected.
        </p>
        <p>The CEO of Streamberry admitted that they had no idea how the quantum computer works and said it was
            essentially magic for all they understood [3]. For software to be reliable, it must be fully understood. All
            aspects should be clearly defined and documented during the development process [1].</p>
