        <h3>Chapter 6: Privacy and the Government</h3>
        <h6>Written by Nia Junod</h6>
        <p>In the unsettling narrative of “Joan is Awful,” the protagonist Joan finds herself trapped in 24/7
            surveillance by Streamberry. Her life, every move, and every waking minute become the subject of a life
            television series produced by StreamBerry, exploiting advanced AI technology to broadcast her life without
            her knowingly consenting[1]. This violation of privacy raises profound legal and ethical questions,
            mirroring the complexities and shortcomings of contemporary privacy laws and the concept of consent in our
            digital era.
        </p>

        <p>This episode resonates with real-world legal discussions and actions aimed at protecting individuals'
            privacy, as discussed in Chapter 6. For instance, the Carpenter v. United States case underscored the
            judicial system's acknowledgment of the importance of warrant-based searches[6], reflecting a legal
            precedent that starkly contrasts with the unwarranted surveillance Joan endures. Furthermore, legislative
            efforts like the National Do Not Call Registry, and the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM)
            Act represent governmental attempts to address privacy invasions[6]. However, they fall short of covering
            the complexities of digital surveillance, which Joan and Salma Hyek suffer from[2].</p>
        <p>Joan’s predicament sheds light on digital consent, where signing up for services often involves agreeing to
            extensive terms that are in small print and may unknowingly waive fundamental privacy rights. Her legal
            battle to regain control over her personal life and stop StreamBerry's invasive broadcasting showcases the
            horrors of existing privacy laws, which are ill-equipped to protect individuals against companies like
            Streamberry, who are there to exploit[5].</p>
        <p>The saga of Joan is a poignant critique of the digital age’s privacy invasions that potentially foreshadow
            our future society, prompting a reevaluation of the legal frameworks governing consent, surveillance, and
            individual rights. It highlights the urgent need for updated legislation that can offer genuine protection
            against non-consensual digital surveillance. They have zero control over their own image; only Streamberry
            can [4]. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and
            the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are examples of laws designed to protect
            personal information in specific sectors[6]. Still, Joan’s case reveals a gap in comprehensive legal
            protections encompassing the digital realm’s unique challenges. She cannot sue or move forward to better her
            case [3]; she is entirely stuck and locked into the contract.</p>
        <p>By weaving in Joan, which is awful with these laws and legal precedents, we’re called to reevaluate the
            balance between technological advancements and preserving privacy. Joan is Awful is a critical reminder of
            the necessity for a legal system that intertwines the up-and-coming digital world and protects individuals'
            rights.</p>
