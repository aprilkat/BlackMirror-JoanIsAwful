        <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
        <p>This chapter discusses various topics related to privacy and government intrusion, including FOIA, tollbooth
            records, the Carpenter v United States case, invasion of privacy, and government actions to prevent
            invasion. These topics are highly relevant to the movie Joan is Awful, as the protagonist, Joan, faces
            challenges in maintaining her privacy and autonomy against government and societal forces.

        </p>
        <p>FOIA and tollbooth records raise concerns about surveillance and privacy implications, as seen in the Melanie
            McGuire case, where E-ZPass records were used in a murder investigation. Joan’s attempt to protect her
            privacy mirrors the government’s efforts to mitigate such intrusions.

        </p>
        <p>The Carpenter v. United States case highlights the importance of protecting individual privacy against
            government intrusion. Joan’s private communications were accessed without her consent or a proper warrant,
            echoing Carpenter’s fight against the warrantless seizure of his cell phone records.
        </p>
        <p>Invasion of privacy includes government actions and technologies that infringe on individual privacy, such as
            telemarketing and loud TV commercials. These parallel Joan’s experiences with the unauthorized sharing of
            personal information or surveillance.
        </p>
        <p>Government actions to prevent invasions, such as the National Do Not Call Registry, regulation of
            pseudoephedrine sales, and laws like the CALM Act to control loud television commercials, show how the
            government responds to public concerns about privacy invasion while addressing broader societal issues.
            Joan’s attempt to safeguard her privacy demonstrates her desire for control and autonomy over her
            information, which is constantly streamed and recorded for StreamBerry.</p>
        <p>The chapter’s topics have strong parallels with the split of the movie Joan is Awful. They highlight the
            importance of protecting individual privacy against government intrusion and societal forces while balancing
            privacy rights with public safety and security. Joan’s story serves as a reminder of how delicate this
            balance can be and how important it is to safeguard our privacy and autonomy in the face of modern
            technology and surveillance.
