        <h3>Chapter 4: Intellectual Property</h3>
        <h6>Written by Nia Junod</h6>
        <p>In the Black Mirror Episode, "Joan is Awful," the concept of intellectual property is explored uniquely. The
            show depicts Joan's life and how her every move is turned into a live television series generated by an AI
            quantum computer without her consent. The show highlights the importance of ownership and control over
            someone's personal life as Joan tries to talk to her lawyer, who says that she has already consented and
            that nothing more can be done to stop the show.
        </p>
        <p>The show also raises questions about copyright law and fair use, as Streamberrry commercially exploits Joan's
            life and how awful everyone else's. It explores the ethical implications of using real-life events without
            property consent or attribution.
        </p>
        <p>The episode further reflects concerns about digital technology's impact on personal privacy and creative
            control. Streamberri's use of advanced technology, such as the quantum computer, challenges confidentiality
            and data usage and blurs reality and entertainment.</p>
        <p>This show exposes and teaches the importance of creators controlling how their work is used and distributed.
            It also emphasizes the need to be aware of creators' rights, essential for protecting innovation and
            creativity. Ultimately, "Joan is Awful" reminds us that intellectual property rights are crucial in today's
            digital age and that we must balance protecting creators' rights and promoting innovation.
