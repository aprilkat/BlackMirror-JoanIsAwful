            <p>Throughout this Black Mirror episode, the technologies contained are utilized in various ways.</p>

            <p>Throughout the episode, various modern devices were used in the same manner as they are used today.
                Smartphones were seen being utilized for communication and even streaming the episodes of Joan is Awful.
                The other technologies were utilized in their usual way, showcasing the integration of modern technology
                into the storyline. </p>

            <p>In the plot of the show, one of the most important technologies is the streaming service Streamberry.
                This service operates much like the usual streaming services that we are all familiar with but with an
                added twist. The show ties in three advanced forms of computing to power this streaming service. One of
                these technologies is the quantum computer, which is a current technology that is still being developed.
                According to IBM, quantum computers use specialized technology, including computer hardware and
                algorithms that take advantage of quantum mechanics, to solve complex problems that classical computers
                or supercomputers can't solve, or can't solve quickly enough [1].</p>
            <p>In Black Mirror's version of this machine, the quantum computer is highly developed and able to utilize
                CGI to create multiple virtual realities that blur the lines of real and fake. This results in the
                creation of an infinite content creator, capable of willing entire multiverses into existence [2]. It's
                a fascinating and thought-provoking concept that highlights the potential of quantum computing and the
                power it could hold.
